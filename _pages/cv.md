Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Science, North China University of Technology, 2013
* M.S. in Applied Computer Science, The University of Tokyo, 2016
* Ph.D (Visiting Appointment) in Media, Arts and Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2017 - 2019
* Ph.D in Applied Computer Science, The University of Tokyo, 2021

Work experience
======
**Project Researcher - The University of Tokyo**
  * Since April 2020 - CURRENT, Tokyo, Japan.
  * Research and development of novel interfaces, interactions, and experiences with cutting-edge technologies from multiple fields. Especially interested  with speech/voice interfaces and multi-modal interfaces.
  * Research guidance for post-graduate students in the lab.
  * Research consultants to the lab's partner companies.

**Research Scientist Internship - CyberAgent AI Lab**
  * November 2019 ~ December 2019, Tokyo, Japan.
  * During the internship, I proposed a language model based Keyword Spotting (KWS) system, which achieved a better performance (Recall improved up to 40%) than the Google speech API as the baseline. To achieve this, I did the following tasks:
  * Gather people and conducted experiments to create an audio dataset of around 3000 samples of people saying target keywords.
  * Created a system to automatically process the raw data and create datasets using voice-activity detection (VAD), noise reduction, and energy level normalization.
  * Proposed a KWS system that leverages language models to restrict the scope of the recognition for better accuracy and high speed.
  * Replicated state-of-the-art KWS approaches using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and depth-separable CNN (DS-CNN).
  * Created a system to automatically test the proposed system and the Google Speech API using the self-created dataset. The system can run the data with each method to be tested and calculates the recall, precision and the F-1 score for each method.

**Graduate Research Assistant - MIT Media Lab**
  * Studying as a graduate Ph.D student from April 2017 - January 2019. Cambridge, MA, USA
  * Mainly worked with the Object-Based Media Group and Fluid Interfaces Group.
  * In Object-Based Media Group, I led a team to build a soft-robotic wearable device that helps people with hand difficulties (e.g., multiple sclerosis or Arthritis) grasp objects with their own hands without bending their fingers. I led and managed a team of four people, applied for research grants, determining research directions, and developed the system (Published at CHI 2019)
  * In Fluid Interfaces Group, I created a wearable device that detects when a person lost the understanding of unknown words from their brainwave. I initiated and managed the research, implemented the system, and designed the experiment (Published at the IEEE EMBC 2018)
  * As another project, I developed a software system to detect the notes a user plays on a MIDI guitar, and automatically generate fretting pattern to control a robot hand attached on the guitar to play the guitar alongside the user (Project published at NIME 2018, Led by Sang)

**Service Planner - Recruit Co.,Ltd.**
  * Internship, from February 2015 to March 2015, Tokyo, Japan.
  * Proposed a recruiting service JobRainbow, that collect and provide information of LGBT-friendly companies to LGBT job seekers.
  * Project won Recruit Ventures Competition, Business Contest Trigger 2015, Funding raised $10,000.

**Software Engineer Internship - Wantedly Inc.**
  * Internship, from December 2014 - January 2015, Tokyo, Japan.
  * Developed (Objective-C) data transmission and user account management for the Wantedly iOS app. (App Store Best of 2014)

**Program Manager - Microsoft**
  * Internship, from August 2014 to September 2014, Tokyo, Japan.
  * Led a team of three people to improve Bing's search quality and its evaluation metrics.
  * Proposed and produced a search engine measurement system to bridge the gap between search qualities perceived by actual users and by internal evaluators.
  * Proposed features to improve the usability of result page based on different query categories.
